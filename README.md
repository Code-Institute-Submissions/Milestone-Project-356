## Design and structure

* After my online research I wanted to make a clean and concise quiz. I chose to use a bright yellow as the main color for my quiz website to promote happiness and creativity. 
* My second color choice was black and this is a big contrast to yellow and it allows the user to clearly see questions and rules regarding the main part of the site which is the quiz. 
* Finally to to contrast the black I used white so the user can clearly see where they need to click to navigate onto the quiz and through the questions.

### Structure

I didn't want to website to load straight into the quiz. I wanted to create a home page(hub). Number one. To allow more features and other potential travel games to be added. Also so the user can prepare for the quiz and have an understanding how the quiz works before embarking on the quiz at their own discretion.
