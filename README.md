## Future Features

Some additional features I would like to add in the future are as follows:
* Maze game.
* Tile matching game.
As the website is set up as a Hub. The landing page acts as an area for future games to be added. 

# Design and structure

## Structure

The site is simple and made up of a landing page and the quiz page.

* Landing Page - This includes a short and snappy header telling the user what the page is. Along with a button to explain the quiz further.
* Quiz Page - This includes the main quiz. Everything is centered in a responsive container. This page also houses the play again feature and return home feature once the quiz has concluded.

### Colors

* After my online research I wanted to make a clean and concise quiz. I chose to use a bright yellow as the main color for my quiz website to promote happiness and creativity. 
* My second color choice was black and this is a big contrast to yellow and it allows the user to clearly see questions and rules regarding the main part of the site which is the quiz. 
* Finally to contrast the black I used white so the user can clearly see where they need to click to navigate onto the quiz and through the questions.

### Fonts 

I imported [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) using the [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) font. I used this for the whole site for continuity and how easy it is to read.

### Languages Used

[HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) and [Javacript](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/) were used to create this project. Information from w3schools is provided via the links.

### Tools

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
Used for version control via GitPod by using the terminal to Git and Push to GitHub.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
Used to store the project code after being created in GitPod / Git.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
Used to create, edit & preview the project's code.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
Used to select & import the fonts to the project.

# Testing 

## HTML Validation

[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) The HTML pages were run through a HTML Validator.
<details><summary>Landing Page</summary><img src=""></details>
<details><summary>Quiz Page</summary><img src=""></details>

### Errors

Errors I encountered were recitified and noted in commit messages. Issue I had were:
* Using a br element within an ol element. This threw an error stating a br element cannot be a child of ol element.
* Secondly as I did not need anything in my h2 element for the questions. As this was being filled using Javascript. The Validator threw an error saying the value was empty. 
* Thirdly I made the error having my script src for my JS files outside of my body element, thus showing an error.

### Fixes

* The first issue was fixed by removing the br element from my ol and using CSS styling to add padding-bottom to my list items.
* Secondly I fixed the issue by adding quotation marks just to add something in there as mentioned Javascript was being used to add the questions.
* I fixed the third issue by adding my script src inside the body element at the bottom after all other HTML code.

## CSS Validation

[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) The CSS page was run through a CSS Validator.
<details><summary>Stylesheet</summary><img src=""></details>

### Errors

I ran into no errors within my CSS file as I made sure to write quality code using:
* Consistent naming convention
* Organising the code into the order of the page flow.
* Using concise and appropriate comments to outline what the code is doing and to what.
Making sure I followed the above meant I did not need to fix any issues.

## JS Validation

[JS Validator](https://jshint.com/) The JS pages was run through a JS Validator.
<details><summary>modal.js</summary><img src=""></details>
<details><summary>questions.js</summary><img src=""></details>
<details><summary>quiz.js</summary><img src=""></details>

### Errors

I ran into no issues with my modal.js file. Issues that did occur were:
* Had an issue with my quiz.js file where the timerInterval variable was undefined.
* Seecondly had an issue with the quizData variable being undefined in both quiz and questions.js.

### Fixes

* The first issue was fixed by creating a let variable containing timerInterval.
* The second issue remains as the two files are both over 100 lines of code I wanted to keep them seperate for readability. The quiz runs smoothly with no issues and calls upon the quizData faultlessly.
The validator returned no issues with my code other than an undefined variable.

## Responsiveness

The site was tested on the following devices:
* Asus Vivobook Book Pro 16"
* Samsung S23 Ultra
* Samsung S20
* Acer Chromebook 14"
* Google Deveoloper tools. Utilizing all dimensions including the responsive option.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab at the top of the page.
* In the left hand menu find and select 'Pages'.
* From the source select Branch: main.
* Click 'Save'.
* A link will be displayed when published successfully which can be shared and accessed through deployments.

## Credits

When it came to building the quiz I gained inspiration from YouTube videos with channels such as:
* [CodingNepal](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingNepal)
* [Codehal](https://www.youtube.com/@codehal)

These sparked my interest and allowed my to build my very own quiz. I also used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) to help with writing an array and additional features within my quiz. I also went back over Code Institutes study material to utilize as much Javascript as I could. Using these allowed me to create features such as event listeners and my question counter and timer features.
